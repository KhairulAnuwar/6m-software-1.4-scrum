```Implementing scrum will greatly improve productivity and staff wellbeing. Scrum emphasizes value and urgency allowing the staff to prioritize more important tasks using Sprints. Due to the short timeframe of the sprints, the team needs to tactfully prioritize and reorganise  in delivering only the needed features for the school. 

Scrum fosters group cohesiveness and garnering their strength to better problem-solving and knowledge sharing. Daily Scrum meetings help team members to stay focused and identify and address any problems they face. When new information arises, team members are expected to adapt to changing requirements. Scrums empower the team to make decisions , take ownership of their work and fosters transparency and accountability. This result in an increased in trust among the peers and stakeholders and rise in morale.

The IT team will deliver small, functional features iteratively, identifying issues early in the development process and negate costly mistakes. The school can launch the operations in phases and provide timely feedback to the It team.

Providing regular feedback after each sprint review will help to check whether the infrastructure is aligned with the school expectation. Continuous feedback allows the team to make adjustments based on real-time feedback and leads to higher client satisfaction.
Before moving to the next sprint, a sprint retrospective will be conducted to reflect on the good practices, cease poor practices and identify areas of improvement. The meeting is to improve the teamâ€™s performance and productivity.
